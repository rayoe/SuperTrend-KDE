# SuperTrend KDE
Overview: 

The SuperTrend Kernel Optimized indicator combines the SuperTrend trend-following strategy with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to predict the probability of trend reversals. This indicator works on a variety of assets like BTC, EUR/USD, NQ, and more, providing actionable signals to traders.

# How It Works

## SuperTrend Calculation: 
- The indicator uses SuperTrend to detect trends, calculating the trend direction (up or down) based on a multiplier and ATR (Average True Range).

## Kernel Density Estimation (KDE): 
- The KDE algorithm estimates the distribution of closing prices using a selected kernel type. You can choose between:
- Gaussian (bell-shaped curve)
- Uniform (flat distribution)
- Sigmoid (S-shaped curve)

## Probability Calculation: 
- After calculating KDE, the values are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, representing the probability that the trend will continue or reverse.

## Buy/Sell Signals:
- Buy signals occur when the SuperTrend shifts upwards, and the probability value is high.
- Sell signals occur when the SuperTrend shifts downwards, and the probability value is high.

# Key Features

- Customizable KDE Algorithm: Choose the kernel type that best suits your strategy (Gaussian, Uniform, or Sigmoid).
- SuperTrend-based Signals: Trade based on SuperTrend direction and probability of trend reversal.
- Real-time Probability Display: Get live probability readings to assess the strength of the trend.
- Buy and Sell Alerts: Set alerts for trend reversals with high probability.
- Visual Indicators: Arrows show potential entry or exit points based on SuperTrend and KDE probability.

# Settings and Customization

## SuperTrend Settings
- Multiplier: Adjusts the sensitivity of the SuperTrend (recommended range: 1.5 - 3).
- ATR Length: Sets the period for ATR calculation (default: 10).

## KDE Settings
- Kernel Type: Choose between Gaussian, Uniform or Sigmoid.
- Bandwidth: Controls the smoothness of the KDE curve (higher values = smoother).
- Steps: Defines the precision of the KDE calculation (more steps = more accuracy).
- Probability Threshold: Set the threshold for when the signal is considered valid.

## Trend Direction Settings
- Activation Threshold: Defines the minimum KDE value required to trigger a signal.

## Interpreting Probability Values

- High Probability (0.6 - 1): Strong likelihood of trend continuation or reversal. Higher chance for a valid trade.
- Moderate Probability (0.4 - 0.6): A signal is possible, but further confirmation is recommended.
- Low Probability (0 - 0.4): Unlikely to reverse, trends are likely to continue.

# What Makes This Indicator Unique?
- This indicator combines SuperTrend with KDE to give traders a more accurate prediction of potential trend reversals. It provides probabilities, making it easier to decide when to enter or exit a trade based on the likelihood of a trend change.
