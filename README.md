# SuperTrend KDE
 An indicator that determines the trend (so when a candle is a pivot or not) with the help of KDE.

We need non parametric data distribution => KDE

how do we calculate the KDE? 

2 param: bandwidth and the estimator: i.e Gaussian 


What's is the problem that I need to solve right now? 

So we need to get the volatility measured by KDE and use it as a signal to determine the trend and if there is a buy/sell signal.
