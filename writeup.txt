[b]Overview:[/b]

The SuperTrend Kernel Optimized indicator combines the SuperTrend trend-following strategy with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to predict the probability of trend reversals, providing actionable signals to traders.

[b]How It Works[/b]

SuperTrend Calculation:
The indicator uses SuperTrend to detect trends, calculating the trend direction (up or down) based on a multiplier and ATR (Average True Range).

Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):
The KDE algorithm estimates the distribution of closing prices using a selected kernel type. You can choose between:
[list]
[*]Gaussian (bell-shaped curve)
[*]Uniform (flat distribution)
[*]Sigmoid (S-shaped curve)
[/list]

Probability Calculation:
After calculating KDE, the values are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, representing the probability that the trend will continue or reverse.

Buy/Sell Signals:
[list]
[*]Buy signals occur when the SuperTrend shifts upwards, and the probability value is higher than the Activation Threshold.
[*]Sell signals occur when the SuperTrend shifts downwards and the probability value is higher than the Activation Threshold.
[*]Strong Buy signals occur when the SuperTrend shifts upwards, and the probability value is higher than the Strong Signal Threshold.
[*]Strong Sell signals occur when the SuperTrend shifts downwards and the probability value is higher than the Strong Signal Threshold.
